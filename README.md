# Crowdcube Frontend Tech Test

## Background

The React app is a simple SPA that mimics some of Crowdcube's actual website functionality. It has been built with React, Redux & Styled Components. Initially build with Redux's TypeScript scaffold: https://redux-toolkit.js.org/introduction/getting-started#using-create-react-app

We have put together a few pages that we would like to modify with you!

Please clone the repo, run `npm install` and familiarise yourself with the code.

You won't need to edit any code inside the root `api` folder. That's just there to mock some data for the main app to interact with.

## Interview format

The interview is a 1 hour pair programming exercise where you will work with another developer through a set of tasks

The interview will start with a basic introduction to the application and there will be the opportunity to ask questions

You will be the driver and are responsible for directing the overall solution design but we encourage you to vocalise your thoughts with your partner and ask questions.

And yes you can Google commands and documentation as needed.

Good luck!

## How to run

To get started you'll need to start the CRA server, and also have the mock API running.

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run start-api`

Starts the mock API server that will need to be running in order for the CRA dev server to load data.

### `npm run test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
